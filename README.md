<h1> US Labor Statistics Dashboard</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project features an interactive Excel Dashboard designed to analyze and visualize labor market trends across the United States. Using data spanning from 2017 to 2020, the dashboard provides insights into employment figures, wage growth, and industry performance across the states.
The tool allows users to drill down into specific industries (e.g., Construction, Finance, Technology) and view comparative metrics such as "Employees per 1,000 Capita" and "Average Annual Wages."


<h2>The dashboard focuses on four main analytical areas:</h2>

Industry Performance:
-Compares Average Annual Wages across different sectors to identify high-paying industries.
-Visualizes total Employees by Industry to highlight the largest employment sectors.
-Trend Analysis (2017-2020):Tracks the year-over-year progression of Wages vs. Employment counts.
-Helps identify macro-economic trends, such as wage stagnation or employment booms.
-Geographic & Demographic Insights: State-by-State Comparison: Detailed breakdown of employment metrics for each state.
-Population Normalization: Includes a calculated metric for Employees per 1,000 Capita, allowing for fair comparisons between large states (like CA, TX) and smaller ones.
-Dynamic Filtering: Users can filter the entire view by specific Industries (e.g., selecting "Construction" updates all charts to reflect only construction data).
